```bash
node -v
npm install -g node@latest
```
To install the require dependencies, run the following commands: in your terminal:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

**Backend Dependencies**

The project uses `Python` for the backend operations. Check and install the latest pip by running the following commands (respectively):

```bash
pip --version
python.exe -m pip install --update pip
```

After installing the latest pip, you can now run the following commands to install required dependencies for the project:
